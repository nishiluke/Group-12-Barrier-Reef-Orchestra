<h1>CP1406 - 2016 Group Project Plan</h1>
<h2>Group Number 12</h2>
<p><strong>Members: </strong>James Shuttleworth, Yuvan Bernstein, Luke West, Kim Hardie</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The main goal in redesigning this website is to raise awareness of the Barrier Reef Orchestra and what they do, which will hopefully lead to more people attending concerts and getting involved in the Orchestra itself.</p>

<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p> The success of the website will be evaluated from the amount of tickets sold via the Civic Theatre, as well as an increase in the number of applicants and benefactors. </p>

<h2>Target Audience</h2>

<p> The site will be designed to appeal to a younger demographic of people, in particular; ages between 13 - 30. To attract people from this age group the site will have a simple look and feel to it. it will be easy to identify where information can be found. It will include interactive methods like hiding text and being able view the text by pressing a button that says more. It will not have large amounts of texts that may be hard on the eyes. It will also incorporate various images that will make the site look attractive and spunky for the targeted age group, without alienating the older demographic. </p>
