Yuvi Bernstein
We put some tasks up on trello Kim, we pretty much split up the work load so everyone is working on different pages of the website. You can see who's got what on trello but I think we had you working on become a member page and becoming a player page and benefactors or support us page
Yuvi Bernstein
5/3, 1:12pm
Yuvi Bernstein
Which would probably include making forms to join and stuff
Kim Hardie
5/3, 1:17pm
Kim Hardie
Thats pretty easy. Are we adding bootstrap?
Yuvi Bernstein
5/3, 1:24pm
Yuvi Bernstein
Yeh that would be awesome actually also if you could look into implementing the pages to add bootstrap. The latest version of the website is on GitHub, so you could clone the folder of the website from there
Kim Hardie
5/3, 1:33pm
Kim Hardie
Bootstrap need to be done on every page its an entirely new system of lsying things out. Thats why i said look at it now and make a template with it
It will take 10x the work to add it to the oages after
Yuvi Bernstein
5/3, 1:37pm
Yuvi Bernstein
Ohh yeh well there's not too much thats been done at this point, I'm not too sure how this bootstrap thing all work. But once a template has been made with bootstrap. We can just copy the content in right
Think you could set that up for us Kim? Please
Kim Hardie
5/3, 1:38pm
Kim Hardie
Yeah probbably
Yuvi Bernstein
5/3, 1:39pm

5/13, 10:39am
Yuvi Bernstein
How did you go with the forms James? Lindsay is on the Google hang out thing talking about how to do it with java script and stuff
He's saying you can just copy the code he's included, or use any other code aswell
He's just explaining how it works at the moment
There a link to the video conference in slack
James Shuttleworth
5/13, 10:41am
James Shuttleworth
Working on them right now he provided a template for the form and ive just created a google spreadsheet to store the results
Yuvi Bernstein
5/13, 10:43am
Yuvi Bernstein
Ohh sweet, sounds good
James Shuttleworth
5/13, 10:44am
James Shuttleworth
I also made a gmail account for our group  where the details will be sent whenever someone enters their details ill send u guys the login info for it when i get it up and running
Also there are two activities we have to each complete on a site called catme . There is a link to it in your student email. Just thought i would let u guys know in case you havent already seen it
Yuvi Bernstein
5/13, 10:47am
Yuvi Bernstein
Is that the peer evaluation thing
James Shuttleworth
5/13, 10:47am
James Shuttleworth
Yeah i think so its not due till the same time as the assignment
Yuvi Bernstein
5/13, 10:47am
Yuvi Bernstein
Yep
So on slack Lindsay described it as an informal checkup so we can get feedback on how our team is going
He said we should complete it now or in the next couple of days
James Shuttleworth
5/13, 10:52am
James Shuttleworth
Oh yea thats the first activity the feedback is the 2nd. Do we have to make an account on catme or do we just use our uni login details?
Yuvi Bernstein
5/13, 10:56am
Yuvi Bernstein
You need to go to your email
Open up one of the catme emails from Thursday
It's called welcome to catme system
It's only one activity called informal checkup
Ohh yeh sorry You creat an account with you uni email
How'd you go?
Also how are you going Kim with the event pages? Did you find the content
Kim Hardie
5/13, 1:19pm
Kim Hardie
no i still havnt found the content yet
Yuvi Bernstein
5/13, 1:33pm
Yuvi Bernstein
You can have a look at the task sheet again. But all the information we need is on the old website (we are redesigning it). I think Lindsay also posted some future events on the 1406 slack, so check that aswell maybe
Yuvi Bernstein
5/13, 1:39pm
Yuvi Bernstein
James when you had a look at events did you any info on it else where?
James Shuttleworth
5/13, 1:41pm
James Shuttleworth
Theres the stuff on the old website under past events and theres a bunc of content in the zip file on learnjcu .. idk if there's anything to do with events in there though
Kim Hardie
5/13, 1:42pm
Kim Hardie
ill make the pages upload them then if we find events we can add them

Also past events are just on the old website
We were here for 9 am and sat in 11 prac, I don't think anyone is gonna stay for the 3 to 5 so you can probably just stay home if you want Kim and work on it from there

So that's all the content for the events pages, and then if you could have a look at the other pages and send us your thought, what can be improved and stuff like that. Or even make fixes where you can that would be awesome
I think we should try and have the site completely done by Friday and then just use next week just for user testing and stuff
Kim Hardie
5/17, 12:06pm
Kim Hardie
okay. if i make any fixes ill list them on trello
Yuvi Bernstein
5/17, 12:06pm
Yuvi Bernstein
Cool
The most updated version of the site, is on GitHub. Make sure you clone it from there to add the events pages to it
You probably already new that but tongue emoticon

I think that's pretty good, maybe have a look at the marking rubric and compare it to that. See if there is anything we might have missed by accidentally or something. I changed the look of some of the heading and stuff on Tuesday to make it look the same on every page. Maybe the home page could be constructed abit different to make it look nice if you like
Kim Hardie
11:03am
Kim Hardie
alright ill give it a good shot
at home feeling pretty sick atm
Yuvi Bernstein
